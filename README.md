# PivotalTracker ticket please

This Chrome extension adds the PivotalTracker ticket link (URL) into the top
of your GitHub pull request description smartly.

## How to use

Install this chrome extension and click on the extension's button when writing
the pull request description on GitHub and watch the magic happens!

## How It Works

For example, if your PivotalTracker ticket ID is 1234567890, this extension
assumes your branch name to be something like:

```
1234567890-my-pull-request
```
